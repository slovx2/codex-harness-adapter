# Changelog

All notable public-facing changes for Codex Harness Adapter are summarized here.
The project is still private in `package.json`; this file tracks release notes
for maintainers preparing the next public release and does not change package
versioning or publishing metadata.

## 0.4.2

- Pi 支持 `thread/archive` / `thread/unarchive`：归档只改变适配器侧列表状态，不改动 Pi 原生会话文件；
  `thread/list` 按 `archived` 过滤，归档活动会话会先中断当前回合。

## 0.4.1

- CLI 启动时读取 `~/.codex-harness-adapter/env`（每行 `KEY=VALUE`），后台服务也可配置
  `CHA_CLAUDE_*`、`PI_CLI`、代理等；启动进程已有的同名变量优先。
- 文档补充 Homebrew 用法、环境文件与 Claude 登录前提，标注仅适用于远程 shim 部署的内容，删除过时的 `TYRS_HAND.md`。

## 0.4.0

- macOS 可通过 `brew install slovx2/tap/codex-harness-adapter` 安装，并用
  `brew services` 在后台常驻；依赖 Homebrew 的 `node@24`。
- Node 要求放宽为 24（>= 24.0.0）；CLI 检查不满足时直接报错。
- Linux 运行包不再附带 Node，改用宿主 PATH 中的 Node 24。
- CLI 通过符号链接启动时按真实安装位置推导根目录。

## Unreleased

### App-server and protocol compatibility

- Updated the adapter to advertise Codex app-server protocol v2 compatibility at
  the current pinned Codex CLI compatibility version, while keeping a
  `codex-harness-adapter` suffix so hosts can distinguish the adapter from upstream
  Codex.
- Expanded Codex App Remote coverage across thread lifecycle, turn envelopes,
  item streaming, approvals, MCP status, fuzzy file search sessions, Claude
  skills/hooks, and `thread/turns/list` item views.
- Added protocol fixture coverage for `config/read`, including the sanitized
  `config.provider_loop_config` shape, so the Rust fixture drift gate covers
  provider-loop config projection behavior.
- Kept compatibility-only account, plugin, marketplace, realtime, and other
  OpenAI-specific surfaces inert or schema-shaped where Claude Code has no
  equivalent.
- Aligned `process/spawn` and `command/exec` with Codex 0.157.1: 10s default
  timeout with exit code 124, immediate process-group SIGKILL on
  kill/terminate/disconnect/timeout, 1 MiB per-stream output cap with
  `capReached` on the truncating chunk, 2s post-exit output drain, native error
  codes and messages, and the native non-inheritable environment filtering.
  PTY sessions keep running through `scripts/pty-bridge.py` (handshake reports
  spawn success or failure), which the packaged runtime now ships alongside a
  `--pty-self-check` build gate.
- Ported `gitDiffToRemote` from Codex 0.157.1 `git-utils`: the base is the
  closest commit that also exists on a remote (current branch, default branch,
  then remote branches containing HEAD), the diff includes unpushed commits and
  untracked files, and a missing base is a -32600 error.
- Aligned `fuzzyFileSearch` sessions with Codex: the tree is indexed once
  (hidden entries, directories, symlinks followed, gitignore only inside git
  repos), `sessionUpdate` responds before `sessionUpdated` + `sessionCompleted`,
  stale queries are dropped, and `sessionStop` sends no completion. Unlike
  Codex, notifications go to the connection that last started or updated the
  session instead of every connection.
- Implemented `thread/backgroundTerminals/list|terminate|clean` over the live
  turn's background Bash tasks (`background_tasks_changed` / `stopTask`).
  Background shells end with the per-turn CLI, and `processId` matches the Bash
  item (`claude:<toolUseId>`) rather than a numeric OS pid.

### Provider and multi-agent boundaries

- Added the provider and multi-agent loop boundaries RFC to separate runtime
  backends, provider metadata, agent-loop fidelity, credential ownership, and
  subscription/entitlement boundaries.
- Added static provider/agent-loop descriptors with validation for allowed and
  unsupported credential source labels.
- Added sanitized provider-loop projection helpers and exposed the read-only
  `config.provider_loop_config` field through `config/read`.
- Added explicit provider/agent-loop selection for known descriptor ids and loop
  ids. Selection maps only to existing runtime backends, preserves legacy
  runtime environment overrides and `CHA_CLAUDE_MOCK=1` precedence, filters
  raw saved selection keys from public `config/read`, and exposes sanitized
  selection metadata through `config.provider_loop_config.selection`.
- Added tests proving built-in descriptors validate cleanly, unsupported
  credential labels are not projected as allowed, and secret-like descriptor
  text is redacted from public projection results.

### Rust-first protocol groundwork

- Added the Rust-first runtime boundaries RFC, keeping the TypeScript
  app-server adapter as the shipping runtime path while defining incremental
  Rust protocol, transport, store, and launcher boundaries.
- Added an experimental Rust workspace scaffold and protocol crate with
  representative Codex app-server JSON fixtures.
- Added Rust parse/reserialize tests for the covered fixtures.
- Added a pinned fixture drift check against the configured Codex CLI version
  and made it part of CI alongside `cargo test --workspace`.
- Extended fixture coverage to include config projection data without claiming a
  Rust production runtime, transport, store, or provider execution path.

### Release readiness and compliance docs

- Added open-source compliance documentation and release-readiness reference
  material for maintainers and reviewers.
- Clarified the README and documentation homepage around the TypeScript
  production path, Rust-first experimental boundaries, provider/agent-loop
  descriptor and selection boundaries, supported credential ownership models,
  unsupported subscription/session/private endpoint/bypass behavior, and release
  verification expectations.
- Documented provider selection configuration for `CHA_CLAUDE_PROVIDER`,
  `CHA_CLAUDE_AGENT_LOOP`, saved provider-loop config keys, precedence rules,
  and sanitized `config.provider_loop_config.selection` projection.
- Documented the current shippable baseline: TypeScript remains the production
  path; Rust pieces are opt-in protocol boundary work; provider/loop descriptors
  are read-only metadata, not runtime dispatch.
- Documented supported credential ownership models: local user-provided API
  keys, official cloud-provider credential chains, organization-managed
  gateways, and local CLI auth for same-host user-directed execution.
- Documented unsupported credential models, including personal subscription
  sharing, browser cookie/session-token reuse, private provider endpoints,
  bypass guidance, and credential redistribution.

### Validation and release gates

- Default CI runs Biome checks, TypeScript typechecking, the Node test suite,
  Rust workspace tests, and the pinned Rust protocol fixture drift gate.
- Documentation changes should run `npm run docs:build`.
- Credentialed smoke and acceptance checks remain opt-in and must use
  credentials already owned by the local user or organization on the host.

### Still experimental or not yet included

- No Rust production runtime, transport, store, provider execution path, or
  default-on Rust launcher is included.
- No executable new provider loop is included beyond the existing runtime
  backends.
- No broad runtime dispatch rewrite is included.
- No new credential collection model is included.
- No support is included for personal subscription sharing, credential pooling,
  browser cookie/session-token reuse, private provider endpoints, or provider
  bypass behavior.
